abstract={Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are being used extensively in the government, and private sectors to perform what were once manned missions. However, authorization to operate UAS unrestricted within organized airspace systems among civil air traffic remains virtually non-existent. A major technological and confidence barrier is the lack of an onboard Sense And Avoid (SAA) system capable of providing UAS with the ability to avoid collisions with other aircraft. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has been developing an SAA system initially consisting of Electro-Optical (EO) sensors and a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) for sensing non-cooperative and cooperative aircraft along with autonomous "avoid," or maneuvering, logic. This system underwent flight test under AFRL's Sense And Avoid Flight Test (SAAFT) program. This work has been continued under AFRL's Multiple Intruder Autonomous Avoidance (MIAA) program, in which a surrogate SAA radar was added as a second non-cooperative aircraft detection sensor, and a Garmin Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) GDL-90 Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) was added as a second cooperative aircraft detection sensor. Furthermore, the autonomous avoidance algorithm, known as Jointly Optimal Conflict Avoidance (JOCA) was enhanced to deal effectively with avoidance of multiple aircraft. AFRL recently conducted a series of SAA flight tests to evaluate the performance of these systems during flight. The SAA hardware and software were installed in a variable stability Learjet which acted as a surrogate High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) UAS.

abstract={This paper describes an approach based on reachability calculations for ensuring robust operation guarantees in flight maneuver sequences performed by unmanned aerial vehicles under supervision of human operators, with applications to safety-critical scenarios. Using a hybrid system formalism to model the maneuver sequence, the paper devises systematic procedures for designing switching conditions to ensure the properties of safety, target attainability, and invariance, using Hamilton-Jacobi reachability calculations. These calculations lay the foundations for refining or designing protocols for multiple unmanned aerial vehicle and/or manned vehicle interaction. The mathematical foundations necessary are described in order to formulate verification problems on reachability and safety of flight maneuvers, including issues of command latency and disturbance. An example of this formalism is given in the context of automated aerial refueling, to inform unmanned aerial vehicle decisions that avoid unsafe scenarios while achieving mission objectives.

abstract={Collision avoidance is of vital importance to the autonomous flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). This especially is true for small UAVs flying at low heights, which usually encounter a large number of mostly static obstacles. Due to a limited knowledge of the environment and small computing power, collision-avoidance algorithms need to rely on little information while being computationally efficient. Guidance laws are one way of tackling such difficulties. The remaining design parameters are determined considering convergence and performance properties of the closed guidance loop. Then, the guidance framework is developed in terms of a constrained optimization problem that can avoid multiple obstacles simultaneously while incorporating other mission objectives. Although avoiding collisions is often crucial to mission success, it is rarely the only or primary objective. This reveals the need for an integrated approach simultaneously considering a given mission objective and collision avoidance with an arbitrary number of potentially moving obstacles.},

abstract={Civil and military unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) operations are currently subject to restrictions that put major limits on their use of airspace. There is considerable debate about how to develop the safe, secure and efficient integration of UAS into non-segregated airspace and aerodromes. This paper examines a necessary safety aspect. Airlines and their passengers would obviously ask, Is it still safe with all these unmanned aircraft around? The spotlight must be on Air Traffic Control Systems as High Reliability Organizations (HRO). That status comes from industry characteristics: focus on safety, effective use of technological improvements, learning from feedback from accidents/incidents, and an underpinning safety culture. The safety of ATC Systems has improved dramatically: accidents are now the product of rare and complex 'messes' of multiple failures. It is therefore a major challenge to preserve the HRO status by ensuring at least current safety performance. The analysis sketches feasible processes of policy decision-making and safety analyses. Key factors are policies on UAS equipage and airspace usage, implementation of a Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)-variant appropriate for UAS, use of an 'Equivalent Level of Safety' philosophy, small datalink latencies, proven HRO safety and learning cultures, and stress testing of system resilience by real-time simulations.

abstract={Integrating UAV traffic into airspace requires that deconfliction of UAV flights from those of aircraft operating under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) can be achieved. Today, the separation of two aircraft flying under VFR relies on the "see and avoid" principle but sometimes fails for reasons like high closing-in speed or pilot lack of vigilance. Equipment can be considered to solve this problem and, providing they are fitted to most of flying vehicles, they could dramatically change the picture of UAVs incoming into the airspace. Such an equipment, designed to provide assistance to light general aviation aircraft pilots in case of a risk of collision, delivers a voice message to the pilots giving them information to visually acquire each other. Once in visual contact, they both apply usual VFR to avoid collision. Fitting UAV with a similar equipment would change the "see and avoid" concept into a "sense and avoid" concept. In case of a conflicting flight path between a UAV and a manned aircraft, the pilot of the aircraft would vocally get information enhancing his capability to visually acquire the UAV while the UAV would "numerically sense" the light aircraft. Both would then be able to modify their flight path to avoid collision. Â© 2005 Published by Elsevier SAS.},

abstract={For Unmanned Aircraft to be routinely used in civil airspace, an effective collision avoidance function is one area deemed essential for safe operation. Like manned aircraft, avoiding collisions with transponder-equipped, or "cooperative" traffic is among the primary hazards.

Potential sensitivities and shortcomings of the TCAS collision avoidance system for unmanned aircraft are discussed.

A computer program has been developed to carry out the platform design. To minimize airframe weight, high modulus carbon fiber composite material has been used extensively. Airfoil coordinates and wing planform have been optimized in order to achieve the best possible aerodynamic efficiency by using integral panel/boundary-layer methods and also to obtain the minimum possible induced drag with respect to local Reynolds airfoil. To this effect, several wind-tunnel tests were carried out so as to compare the analytically predicted airfoil performances. After an initial configuration had been worked out, a scale technological demonstrator (wing span 24 m) was designed, manufactured, and tested under shear, bending, and torsion loads. Finite element analysis was also carried out in order to predict the static and dynamic behavior of both the full-size and scale model versions of the HeliPlat structure. The preliminary static test resulted in a high correspondence.},

abstract={Inexpensive fixed wing UAVs are increasingly useful in remote sensing operations. They are a cheaper alternative to manned vehicles, and are ideally suited for dangerous or monotonous missions that would be inadvisable for a human pilot. Groups of UAVs are of special interest for their abilities to coordinate simultaneous coverage of large areas, or cooperate to achieve goals such as mapping. Cooperation and coordination in UAV groups also allows increasingly large numbers of aircraft to be operated by a single user. Specific applications under consideration for groups of cooperating UAVs are border patrol, search and rescue, surveillance, communications relaying, and mapping of hostile territory. The capabilities of small UAVs continue to grow with advances in wireless communications and computing power. Accordingly, research topics in cooperative UAV control include efficient computer vision for real-time navigation and networked computing and communication strategies for distributed control, as well as traditional aircraft-related topics such as collision avoidance and formation flight. Emerging results in cooperative UAV control are presented via discussion of these topics, including particular requirements, challenges, and some promising strategies relating to each area. Case studies from a variety of programs highlight specific solutions and recent results, ranging from pure simulation to control of multiple UAVs. This wide range of case studies serves as an overview of current problems of interest, and does not present every relevant result.},

abstract={A navigation strategy that exploits the optic flow and inertial information to continuously avoid collisions with both lateral and frontal obstacles has been used to control a simulated helicopter flying autonomously in a textured urban environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the corresponding controller generates cautious behavior, whereby the helicopter tends to stay in the middle of narrow corridors, while its forward velocity is automatically reduced when the obstacle density increases. When confronted with a frontal obstacle, the controller is also able to generate a tight U-turn that ensures the UAV's survival.

abstract={Navigation problems of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) flying in a formation in a free and an obstacle-laden environment are investigated in this brief. When static obstacles popup during the flight, the UAVs are required to steer around them and also avoid collisions between each other. In order to achieve these goals, a new dual-mode control strategy is proposed: a "safe mode" is defined as an operation in an obstacle-free environment and a "danger mode" is activated when there is a chance of collision or when there are obstacles in the path. Safe mode achieves global optimization because the dynamics of all the UAVs participating in the formation are taken into account in the controller formulation. In the danger mode, a novel algorithm using a modified Grossberg neural network (GNN) is proposed for obstacle/ collision avoidance. This decentralized algorithm in 2-D uses the geometry of the flight space to generate optimal/suboptimal trajectories. Extension of the proposed scheme for obstacle avoidance in a 3-D environment is shown. In order to handle practical vehicle constraints, a model predictive control-based tracking controller is used to track the references generated. Numerical results are provided to motivate this approach and to demonstrate its potential. Â© 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel control strategy, which we call optiPilot, for autonomous flight in the vicinity of obstacles. Most existing autopilots rely on a complete 6-degree-of-freedom state estimation using a GPS and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and are unable to detect and avoid obstacles. This is a limitation for missions such as surveillance and environment monitoring that may require near-obstacle flight in urban areas or mountainous environments. OptiPilot instead uses optic flow to estimate proximity of obstacles and avoid them. Our approach takes advantage of the fact that, for most platforms in translational flight (as opposed to near-hover flight), the translatory motion is essentially aligned with the aircraft main axis. This property allows us to directly interpret optic flow measurements as proximity indications. We take inspiration from neural and behavioural strategies of flying insects to propose a simple mapping of optic flow measurements into control signals that requires only a lightweight and power-efficient sensor suite and minimal processing power. In this paper, we first describe results obtained in simulation before presenting the implementation of optiPilot on a real flying platform equipped only with lightweight and inexpensive optic computer mouse sensors, MEMS rate gyroscopes and a pressure-based airspeed sensor. We show that the proposed control strategy not only allows collision-free flight in the vicinity of obstacles, but is also able to stabilise both attitude and altitude over flat terrain. These results shed new light on flight control by suggesting that the complex sensors and processing required for 6 degree-of-freedom state estimation may not be necessary for autonomous flight and pave the way toward the integration of autonomy into current and upcoming gram-scale flying platforms.

abstract={This paper implements robust Decentralized Model Predictive Control (DMPC) for a team of cooperating Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The problem involves vehicles with independent dynamics but with coupled constraints to capture required cooperative behavior. Using a recently-developed form of DMPC, each vehicle plans only for its own actions, but feasibility of the sub-problems and satisfaction of the coupling constraints are guaranteed throughout, despite the action of unknown but bounded disturbances. UAVs communicate relevant plan data to ensure that decisions are consistent across the team. Collision avoidance is used as an example of coupled constraints and the paper shows how the speed, turn rate and avoidance distance limits in the optimization should be modified in order to guarantee robust constraint satisfaction. Integer programming is used to solve the non-convex problem of path-planning subject to avoidance constraints. Numerical simulations compare computation time and target arrival time under decentralized and centralized control and investigate the impact of decentralization on team performance. The results show that the computation required for DMPC is significantly lower than for its centralized counterpart and scales better with the size of the team, at the expense of only a small increase in UAV flight times.},

abstract={We consider the problem of optimal cooperative three-dimensional conflict resolution involving multiple Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) using numerical trajectory optimization methods. The conflict problem is posed as an optimal control problem of finding trajectories that minimize a certain objective function while maintaining the safe separation between each UAV pair. We assume the origin and destination of the UAV are known and consider UAV models with simplified linear kinematics. The main objective of this report is to present two different approaches to the solution of the problem. In the first approach, the optimal control is converted to a finite dimensional Nonlinear Program (NLP) by using collocation on finite elements and by reformulating the disjunctions involved in modeling the protected zones by using continuous variables. In the second approach the optimal control is converted to a flnite dimensional Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) using Euler discretization and reformulating the disjunctions involved with the protected zones by using binary variables and Big-M techniques. Based on results of extensive random simulations, we compare time complexity and optimality of the solutions obtained with the MILP approach and the NLP approach. NLPs are essential to enforce flyability constraints on more detailed UAV models. Moreover, any nonlinear extensions to the problem cannot be dealt with by MILP solvers. The main objective of this paper is to open the route to the use of MILP solutions (based on simple linear UAV models) in order to initialize NLP solvers which allow the use of dynamic UAV models at any desired level of detail.

abstract={A method of collision avoidance is described by using simple geometric approach. Two UAVs are dealt with and considered as point masses with constant velocity. This paper discusses en route aircraft which are assumed to be linked by real time data bases like ADS-B. With this data base, all UAVs share the information each other. Calculating PCA (Point of Closest Approach), we can evaluate the worst conflict condition between two UAVs. This paper proposes one resolution maneuvering logic, which can be called 'Vector Sharing Resolution'. In case of conflict, using miss distance vector in PCA, we can decide the directions for two UAVs to share the conflict region. With these directions, UAVs are going to maneuver cooperatively. First of all, this paper describes some '2-D' conflict scenarios and then extends to '3-D' conflict scenarios. Â© 2008 SICE.},

abstract={We present a goal-directed 3D reactive obstacle avoidance algorithm specifically designed for Rotorcraft Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (RUAVs) that fly point-to-point type trajectories. The algorithm detects potential collisions within a cylindrical Safety Volume projected ahead of the UAV. This is done in a 3D occupancy map representation of the environment. An expanding elliptical search is performed to find an Escape Point; a waypoint which offers a collision free route past obstacles and towards a goal waypoint. An efficient occupied voxel checking technique is employed which approximates the Safety Volume by a series of spheres, and uses an approximate nearest neighbour search in a Bkd-tree representation of the occupied voxels. Tests show the algorithm can typically find an Escape Point in under 100 ms using onboard UAV processing for a cluttered environment with 20 000 occupied voxels. Successful collision avoidance results are presented from simulation experiments and from flights with an autonomous helicopter equipped with stereo and laser range sensors. Â© 2011 IEEE.STEREO???},

abstract={SUMMARY The increased use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is coincidentally accompanied by a notable lack of sensors suitable for enabling further improvement in levels of autonomy and, consequently, integration into the National Airspace System (NAS). The majority of available sensors suitable for UAV integration into the NAS are based on infrared detectors, focal plane arrays, optical and ultrasonic rangefinders, etc. These sensors are generally not able to detect or identify other UAV-sized targets and, when detection is possible, considerable computational power is typically required for successful identification. Furthermore, the performance of visual-range optical sensor systems may suffer when operating under conditions that are typically encountered during search and rescue, surveillance, combat, and most other common UAV applications. However, the addition of a miniature RADAR sensor can, in consort with other sensors, provide comprehensive target detection and identification capabilities for UAVs. This trend is observed in manned aviation where RADAR sensors are the primary on-board detection and identification sensors. In this paper, a miniature, lightweight X-band RADAR sensor for use on a miniature (710-mm rotor diameter) rotorcraft is described. We present an analysis of the performance of the RADAR sensor in a realistic scenario with two UAVs. Additionally, an analysis of UAV navigation and collision avoidance behaviors is performed to determine the effect of integrating RADAR sensors into UAVs. Further study is also performed to demonstrate the scalability of the RADAR for use with larger UAV classes. Â© 2013 Cambridge University Press .},

abstract={In this work, we propose a novel intermediate control layer for obstacle avoidance and drift suppression. It runs in between high level software layers responsible for environment mapping and path planning and low level software ensuring stable and level flight. This allows more complex algorithms with longer computation intervals for higher-level tasks. By modularizing the robot control, we also enable the reuse of our obstacle avoidance layer for different high-layer algorithms. The feasibility of separation in software will be shown, leading the way for a potential physical separation with dedicated hardware later on. A prototypical implementation of the intermediate layer using ultrasonic sensors was built. We demonstrate the feasibility of the chosen sensor concept in presence of propeller noise. The control concept is kept on a level that can be implemented on onboard processors - this does also include the communication with the sensors. Experimental results with this first implemented prototype are presented and discussed. We analyze the ranging capabilities of the ultrasonic sensor and validate its applicability in obstacle avoidance tasks. Â© 2014 IEEE.},

Since June 2003, we have been successfully flying the two automated DragonFly aircraft simultaneously, in dual vehicle approach patterns, and have demonstrated our automatic collision avoidance system on this platform (one aircraft 'blunders' into the path of the second, the other invokes an 'emergency escape maneuver' based on the relative configuration of the two aircraft). In June 2004, based on the success of our DragonFly tests, we flew our software on a Boeing test platform of two aircraft: an F-15, and a T-33 test aircraft.automatic escape, emergency},

abstract={The US Federal Aviation Administration's Next Generation (NextGen) upgrade proposes a fundamental transformation that is intended to increase the capacity and safety of the air transportation system. A key component of the upgrade is the Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) system. ADS-B provides continual broadcast of aircraft position, identity, velocity and other information over unencrypted data links to generate a precise air picture for air traffic management. The Federal Aviation Administration claims that operational requirements necessitate the use of unencrypted data links and maintains that there is a low likelihood of malicious exploitation.This paper analyzes the security vulnerabilities associated with the ADS-B implementation. It describes a taxonomy of attacks and examines the potential impact that the attacks may have on air transportation operations. The taxonomy helps provide a comprehensive understanding of the threats associated with the ADS-B implementation, thereby supporting risk analysis and risk management efforts. The paper also provides recommendations that could enhance security if integrated into the ADS-B implementation plan. Â© 2011.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are acquiring an increased level of autonomy as more complexmission scenarios are envisioned [1]. For example, UAVs are being used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions as well as to assist humans in the detection and localization of wildfires [2], tracking of moving vehicles along roads [3], [4], and performing border patrol missions [5]. A critical component for networks of autonomous vehicles is the ability to detect and localize targets of interest in a dynamic and unknown environment. The success of these missions hinges on the ability of the algorithms to appropriately handle the uncertainty in the information of the dynamic environment and the ability to cope with the potentially large amounts of communicated data that will need to be broadcast to synchronize information across networks of vehicles. Because of their relative simplicity, centralized mission management algorithms have previously been developed to create a conflict-free task assignment (TA) across all vehicles. However, these algorithms are often slow to react to changes in the fleet and environment and require high bandwidth communication to ensure a consistent situational awareness (SA) from distributed sensors and also to transmit detailed plans back to those sensors.

abstract={As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become increasingly autonomous, time-critical and complex single-operator systems will require advance prediction and mitigation of schedule conflicts. However, actions that mitigate a current schedule conflict may create future schedule problems. Decision support is needed allowing an operator to evaluate different mission schedule management options in real-time. This paper describes two decision support visualisations for single-operator supervisory control of four independent UAVs performing a time-critical targeting mission. A configural display common to both visualisations, called StarVis, graphically depicts current scheduleproblems, as well as projections of potential local and global schedule problems. Results from an experiment showed that subjects using the locally optimal StarVis implementation had better performance, higher situational awareness, and no significant increase in workloadover a more globally optimal implementation of StarVis. This research effort highlights how the same decision support design applied at different abstraction levels can produce different performance results.
